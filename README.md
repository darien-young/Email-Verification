Ver 1.0: This program utlizes the Microsoft Graph API, and requires the user to have an Azure Portal for App Registration and API configurations.
          The code currently uses Interactive Browser Configuration, so it has no configurations for using a Client Secret. <br>
          For a localised program, this is fine, but in the event you are doing web apps or daemons: <br><br> <b><i>Please change or add in as necessary for your own use, the ability to use a secret for best 
          practice in security.</i></b>
